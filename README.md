# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Model

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project implements sophisticated deep learning-based models to predict NIfty 50 stock prices on the Indian market. The system leverages historical price data, volume information, and calculated technical indicators to forecast future price movements using various recurrent neural network architectures.

## 💼 Business Impact
- 💰 **Portfolio Management**: Empowers investors to optimize their portfolios based on data-driven price movement predictions
- ⚠️ **Risk Assessment**: Provides quantitative measures to evaluate investment risks before committing capital
- 🤖 **Trading Strategy Development**: Forms the foundation for algorithmic trading systems and rule-based investment approaches
- 📊 **Market Analysis**: Uncovers hidden trends and patterns in stock behavior that might be missed in manual analysis

## 📊 Data Analysis Insights

### Price and Volume Patterns
- 📉 Identified distinct upward trend phases and consolidation periods in Reliance stock over 5 years
- 📆 Discovered volume spikes coinciding with major corporate announcements and price breakouts
- 🔍 Mapped clear support and resistance levels through moving average analysis
- 🌊 Detected volatility clusters during market uncertainty periods

### Technical Indicators
- 🔄 RSI overbought/oversold conditions frequently preceded price reversals
- ↗️ MACD crossovers accurately signaled several major trend changes
- 🔀 Divergences between price and indicators provided early warning of trend exhaustion
- 📏 Moving averages confirmed strength of prevailing trends

### Feature Correlation Analysis
- 🔗 Strong positive correlation between price and long-term moving averages
- 🔌 Weak relationship between daily price changes and trading volume
- 🧮 Moderate negative correlation between RSI values and subsequent price movements
- 📅 Minimal impact of day-of-week on price direction

## ⚙️ Key Features

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- 🧹 Comprehensive missing value handling through forward-filling techniques
- 📊 Technical indicator implementation (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- 📏 Multiple moving average calculations (50, 100, 200-day) for trend identification
- 📉 Volatility metrics using rolling standard deviation methods
- 📊 Price and volume momentum calculations to capture market dynamics

### Visualization Suite
- 📈 Interactive price charts with overlay of multiple moving averages
- 📊 Volume analysis with trend visualization
- 📉 Technical indicator charts with buy/sell signal highlighting
- 🔥 Correlation heatmaps revealing feature importance
- 🎯 Model performance comparisons through prediction vs. actual visualization

### Deep Learning Models
Four distinct neural network architectures implemented and compared:
1. 🧠 **Simple LSTM**: Basic long short-term memory network for baseline performance
2. 🧠🧠 **Stacked LSTM**: Multi-layered LSTM network to capture complex patterns
3. ⚡ **GRU Model**: Gated recurrent unit architecture for computational efficiency
4. 🧠🧠🧠 **Advanced LSTM**: Enhanced architecture with additional layers beyond stacked LSTM for deeper pattern recognition

### Model Evaluation Framework
- 📏 Comprehensive metrics suite (RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE)
- ✓ Cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- 📊 Comparative analysis across architectures
- 🔍 Visual and statistical error analysis

## 📈 Results Summary
The GRU model demonstrated superior performance with:
- 🏆 Lowest RMSE among all tested architectures
- 📈 Highest R² value indicating better fit to actual price movements
- ✅ Most accurate prediction of trend directions (up/down movements)
- 💪 Greatest robustness during market volatility periods

The Stacked LSTM model ranked second in performance, particularly excelling in capturing medium-term price trends but slightly underperforming in high-volatility market conditions.

## 🚀 Future Scope

### Model Enhancements
- 🔍 **Attention Mechanisms**: Implement attention layers to focus on the most relevant parts of input sequences
- 🔄 **Transformer Architecture**: Explore transformer-based models for time series forecasting
- 🤝 **Ensemble Methods**: Develop ensemble approaches combining multiple model predictions
